[27164534] Joe Walnes 2003-09-29 18:03:15 +0000 A weekend worth of changes with no home connectivity - added XMLReaderDriver abstraction to allow easy switching of XML parsers - StringBuffer converter - XMLReader test cases - W3C DOM XMLReader impl (removes DOM4J dependency) - Refactoring: Converters now determine whether they can handle a type - XStream facade: added methods to allow custom XMLReader/Writers to be used - Refactoring: XMLWriter has more sensible test names - Static/final/transient fields are not serialized
