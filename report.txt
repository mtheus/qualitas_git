Title: An Empirical Study on the Relationship Between Software Evolution Metrics and Reliability

Abstract
Software reliability is a key factor in ensuring the quality of software systems. This study investigates the relationship between software evolution metrics derived from version control systems and software reliability. Using data extracted from a repository and analyzed with Code-Maat, we perform an exploratory factor analysis and regression modeling to determine the impact of different metrics on software reliability. Our results highlight the significance of key variables such as the number of commits, number of authors, coupling, and churn rate. The findings provide insights into best practices for improving software dependability.

1. Introduction
Software systems evolve continuously, with modifications and updates impacting their reliability. Understanding the factors that influence software reliability is essential for improving software engineering practices. This study aims to analyze the relationship between software evolution metrics and reliability using statistical methods, particularly exploratory factor analysis and regression modeling. The results can guide software engineers in making informed decisions to enhance software stability and maintainability.

2. Methodology
We collected data from a software repository and extracted various software evolution metrics using Code-Maat. The dataset was analyzed through exploratory factor analysis to identify key latent constructs and multiple regression modeling to assess the impact of these metrics on reliability. Statistical significance was determined using appropriate tests, including Bartlett's test of sphericity and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure for sampling adequacy.

3.1 Exploratory Factor Analysis

Factor analysis identified six main factors that explained 71.8% of the variance in the data. Each factor represents a distinct aspect of software evolution and its potential impact on reliability:

Factor 1 - Development Activity: This factor includes the number of commits (0.901), number of entities (0.858), and number of entities changed (1.009), which indicate the level of ongoing development activity. High values may suggest frequent modifications, which can lead to instability if not managed properly.

Factor 2 - Code Age and Maturity: Capturing max-age in months (0.861) and average age (0.600), this factor reflects the longevity of the codebase. Older code might be more stable due to long-term refinements, whereas younger code could still be evolving and prone to changes.

Factor 3 - Structural Complexity: The degree of coupling (0.864) is a critical indicator of software complexity. Higher coupling means stronger dependencies between modules, which can either enhance modular integrity or introduce brittleness when changes propagate unpredictably.

Factor 4 - Developer Communication and Effort: This factor includes strength of communication (-0.317) and author revision effort (0.786). Stronger communication between team members and increased effort in reviewing changes are essential for maintaining software reliability.

Factor 5 - Code Ownership and Stability: The factor consists of ownership added (0.666) and ownership deleted (0.943). High ownership consistency is beneficial for maintaining reliable software since experienced developers are more familiar with critical components.

Factor 6 - Refactoring Practices: Represented by refactoring main developer ownership (-0.625), this factor suggests that code maintained primarily by one developer could either be optimized through expert-led refactoring or introduce bottlenecks if knowledge is not shared.

3.2 Regression Analysis

A linear regression model was built to predict software reliability based on these factors, yielding an R-squared value of 0.855. The most significant predictors were:

Number of commits: (β = -1.02e-5, p < 0.001) - A higher number of commits negatively impacts reliability, likely due to frequent changes introducing defects.

Number of authors: (β = -5.68e-5, p = 0.045) - A higher number of developers working on the same module correlates with lower reliability, possibly due to inconsistencies in coding practices.

Degree of coupling: (β = 0.00366, p = 0.031) - More interconnected modules may increase modularity but also risk cascading failures if not managed properly.

Strength of communication: (β = 0.00365, p = 0.007) - Enhanced communication positively affects reliability, indicating that coordination among developers is crucial.

Churn rate of commits: (β = -3.34e-4, p = 0.044) - Frequent changes in code negatively impact reliability, reinforcing the importance of controlled software evolution.

4. Discussion
The results demonstrate that software evolution metrics derived from version control systems can provide meaningful insights into software reliability. The significant negative impact of the number of commits and number of authors on reliability suggests that frequent modifications and high developer turnover may introduce instability in the codebase. Additionally, the degree of coupling and communication strength positively correlate with reliability, indicating that well-structured and coordinated development efforts can enhance stability.

Additionally, the degree of coupling and communication strength positively correlate with reliability, suggesting that highly modular software with clear interdependencies benefits from better fault isolation and maintainability. Improved communication among team members facilitates knowledge sharing and code comprehension, reducing the likelihood of defects introduced due to misunderstandings or lack of coordination.

The negative effect of code churn on reliability aligns with previous research, which suggests that frequent changes to the codebase, especially deletions and additions, can lead to increased defect rates. These findings emphasize the need for controlled code modifications and better documentation to mitigate risks associated with rapid software evolution.

By naming and justifying the six identified factors, we provide a structured perspective on how different aspects of software development influence reliability. Our results suggest that practices such as reducing code churn, limiting the number of developers working on a module, and improving communication can significantly enhance software stability.

5. Conclusion
This study empirically analyzed the impact of software evolution metrics on reliability. Our findings indicate that reducing code churn, limiting the number of developers working on a module, and improving communication can significantly enhance software stability. Future work could extend this analysis by incorporating additional repositories and examining the impact of different software development methodologies.
